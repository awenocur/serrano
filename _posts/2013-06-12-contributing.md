The first step in contributing to the code base is [forking the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

If you have an existing fork, make the repo is up-to-date. Always create the branch off the actively developed branch (which will be set as the default branch on GitHub).

### Bug Fixes

- Create a branch
- Once the bug has been fixed (with the proper tests described below) submit a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
- If there is an existing open issue, reference the issue number in the pull
request description.

### New Features

[Open a ticket](https://github.com/cbmi/serrano/issues/new) to describe the feature and why it makes sense to integrate it into the core library. Having code to show the intended implementation is always a plus, so you can supply that as well. In either case simply:

- Create a branch
- Once implemented with tests and documentation, submit a pull request
referencing the open ticket.

### Documentation
