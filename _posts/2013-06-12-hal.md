Serrano implements the [Hypermedia Application Language (HAL)](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) conventions for representing hyperlinks to related resources. This is composed of a `_links` object containing one or more relations each with a `rel` and `href` attributes as well as a few [optional attributes](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html#shared_attributes).

```javascript
{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://example.com"
        },
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

This convention adds [uniformity to the interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) and enables discoverability for client libraries which understand HAL, [which there are quite a few](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html#libraries_for_working_with_hal).
