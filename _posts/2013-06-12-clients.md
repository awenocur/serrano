Having a hypermedia API is great, but without a client to consume it, it is somewhat useless. Listed below are the officially supported and third party client tools that can consume Serrano's API.

## Supported

### [Cilantro](http://cbmi.github.com/cilantro/)

A rich HTML5/JavaScript web client that provides a clean interface for discovering, querying and reporting on data using Serrano APIs. This is the official client of [The Harvest Stack](http://harvest.research.chop.edu) and is guaranteed to stay up-to-date with Serrano APIs. Check out the [demo](http://harvest.research.chop.edu/demo/) to see what it looks like.

_Note: Cilantro is currently under heavy development and various components may be incomplete until it has been released. Keep track of the progress [here](https://github.com/cbmi/cilantro)_

## Third-Party

_Be the first one to write a client, big or small! Scan the list of ideas for some inspiration._

## Ideas & Inspiration

- Command-line interface (CLI) that can consume the APIs
  - One implementation recommendation is using [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
- Field and Concept metadata _appendix_
  - This would act as an _appendix_ for the data available in the system. The focus would be on searchability and presentability of the names, descriptions and other metadata in a readable way
  - The format is similar to AudGenDB's [data descriptions documentation](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/documentation/datafields/)
